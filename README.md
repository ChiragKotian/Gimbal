# Phone Gimbal

Stable videos and photos are liked by everyone and gimbals help for the same but commercial gimbals are very expensive so why not make a cheap DIY alternative 
ourselves.

In this project I made a gimble for my phone.

From the 3D CAD modelling and 3D-printing the parts to the code everything was designed and implemented by me.

## Engineering Description:

This gimbal is a 2-axis gimbal, providing stability in roll and pitch.

Using MPU6050 IMU and Arduino nano, the changes in orientation are determined.

Using this determined change in orientation, a counter motion is generated using servo motors located at strategic locations in the setup.

Everything is powered by Li-ion batteries and is rechargable too.
